           == Bootloader Specification ==
This document will describe the state the bootloader
will leave the system in when handing over control to
the kernel, as well as how the kernel binary should be
laid out.

 > State
The kernel will be started in 64bit Long mode.
The GDT will be set up for a flat memory layout, but
paging will NOT be enabled.

The kernel itself will have been loaded into memory at 
address `0x100000` (1MB).

 > Kernel Binary Header
The magic decimal number `26,985` must be the first two
bytes of the kernel to indicate to the bootloader that
what it thinks is the kernel is in fact the kernel

This must be followed by a single byte denoting the
length of the name of the kernel.

Finally, the name of the kernel should be encoded in
the following bytes. It MUST NOT be null terminated
